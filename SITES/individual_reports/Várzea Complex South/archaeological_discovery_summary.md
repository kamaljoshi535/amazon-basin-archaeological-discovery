### Why Surrounding Coordinates Analysis - Archaeological Site Investigation Strategy

**üèõÔ∏è Archaeological Site Investigation Methodology**: Our 9-coordinate grid analysis follows established archaeological **site boundary detection** and **activity zone mapping** principles:

**üìç Spatial Strategy Rationale**:
1. **Primary Activity Area**: Central coordinate targets the core archaeological zone (highest expected activity)
2. **Peripheral Analysis**: 8 surrounding coordinates (1km spacing) map site boundaries and activity gradients  
3. **Site Extent Mapping**: Grid pattern detects multi-component sites common in Amazon settlements
4. **Validation Framework**: Multiple coordinates prevent false positives from isolated data anomalies

**üéØ Archaeological Logic Behind Grid Approach**:
- **Settlement Patterns**: Amazon archaeological sites often have dispersed activity areas (plazas, residential, ceremonial)
- **Feature Distribution**: Important features may be offset from geographic center (defensive positions, water access)
- **Site Validation**: True archaeological sites show organized spatial patterning vs random landscape features
- **Boundary Detection**: Gradient analysis from center helps define site limits and preservation zones

**üìä Grid Analysis Benefits**:
- **Confidence Validation**: Center enrichment (3-4x higher probability) confirms focused archaeological activity
- **Spatial Context**: Surrounding analysis provides landscape context and site relationships
- **Quality Control**: Multi-point analysis distinguishes archaeological sites from geological anomalies
- **Systematic Coverage**: Ensures comprehensive analysis following archaeological survey standards

**üî¨ Scientific Foundation**: This approach mirrors traditional archaeological survey methodology adapted for remote sensing analysis, providing systematic spatial coverage and validation.
